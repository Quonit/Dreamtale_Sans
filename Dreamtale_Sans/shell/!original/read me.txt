HI this is the readme for the Dreamtale Sans shell. Assuming that you're in here, it must mean you're snooping through the files! Facinating.

If you're wondering how to unlock the illustrious Goopmare shell that you see in the other file you have to go on the negative route. Be very mean. But maybe you already know about this and I am wasting your time. Secrets then! I'm adding Dream to this ghost in the future. You can decide for yourself if that's completely contradictory to the joke of the ghost being "Dreamtale Sans" and yet Dream isn't in it, but I already have! hahahaha

anyways yeah ty for reading ily have a nice day
