--Dreamtale Sans--

This is a very normal ghost of Dreamtale sans.

This ghost is very expansive and has a lot of secrets. The best way to find them is to poke around at the menus and dialogue. There are two main routs you can reach, which I will name the 'good route' and the 'bad route', but there are a lot of secrets and other modes on the way. Those are just some main objectives if you want those.

Things you can do:
Chat - You can to him! Every five minutes (This can be changed in the menu, or you can force him to talk by pressing 'Say Something' (the first option in his double-click menu) he will say a piece of dialogue. Much of this you can respond to and will effect your stats.
Check - You can check your stats in his menu by pressing Act and then pressing Check. It only hints at it though and wont give you the raw numbers.
Act - Through his menu you can pick specific things to talk about. Depending on your stats, you unlock different options.
Ask - You can ask him specific questions! About himself, things he's mentioned before, and people he knows. Depending on what things he's talked about, different things will appear in his menu.
Touch - This ghost has a lot of clickables and pettables. You can trigger different kinds of dialogue depending on if you drag your mouse against specific hitboxes, or if you double click specific hitboxes. Depending on what he thinks of you, his responces may change!
Give Items - You can gift him all sorts of different things! Many of the things you give him, such as food, change depending on what time of day or year it is.

Development start and end dates: 28 June 2019 - April Fools 2020
I made this because Somewhere in March of 2019, I heard somebody talking about Dreamtale sans referring to Dream and I had a little laugh about how there is actually two of them and that technically neither of them are sanses. My brother suggested that I turn that joke into a ghost and I rolled it off as a joke, but on June 28 2019 I decided to start making it for next year's April fools.

Warnings:
There is swearing, implications of self harm, and dark themes scattered around this ghost.
Dreamtale belongs to the AU Undertale fandom. This specific version is a variant for AUBS I made that belongs to me. Enjoy!
