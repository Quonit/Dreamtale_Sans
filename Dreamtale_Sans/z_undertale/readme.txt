This balloon is designed to mimic the look of the Undertale dialogue boxes. It's very simple and will look mostly the same for both characters. It does require the fonts Determination Mono and Determination Sans to look right though, so make sure you have them installed. If you don't have them, you can pick them up from here:

And I'll include them both with the balloon.
